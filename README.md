# Student Database Chatbot Using Gemini Pro Model

This project is a chatbot built with Python, Streamlit, and the Gemini Pro model, integrated with an SQLite3 database. The chatbot allows users to ask questions about student data (such as names, classes, sections, and marks), and provides accurate responses based on the data stored in the database.
